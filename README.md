</sup>
</div>

1. **Backup & Restore:**
   - **Details:** Regularly back up data, configurations, and applications. In case of a disaster, the system is restored to a previous state.
   - **When to Use:** Suitable for systems with moderate recovery time tolerance and less stringent RTO (Recovery Time Objective) requirements. Cost-effective.
   - **When Not to Use:** Not recommended for scenarios where near-zero downtime is crucial for core banking operations.

2. **Pilot Light:**
   - **Details:** Maintain a minimal version of the core system in the cloud, preconfiguring essential elements for rapid scaling and recovery in case of a disaster.
   - **When to Use:** Appropriate when quick recovery is necessary, and the focus is on minimizing ongoing costs.
   - **When Not to Use:** May not be suitable for systems where rapid scaling is a critical requirement, and the cost of maintaining a minimal system is not justified.

3. **Warm Standby:**
   - **Details:** Keep a scaled-down version of the entire system ready to take over swiftly in the event of a disaster, balancing cost-effectiveness and the urgency of rapid recovery.
   - **When to Use:** Suitable when quick recovery is crucial, and cost considerations are significant.
   - **When Not to Use:** May not be the most cost-efficient option for systems with lower availability requirements.

4. **Multi-Site Active-Active:**
   - **Details:** Run multiple active sites simultaneously, providing high availability and fault tolerance.
   - **When to Use:** Ideal for systems demanding continuous availability, real-time data synchronization, and the ability to handle a complete failure of one site.
   - **When Not to Use:** May be overkill for systems where cost-effectiveness is a higher priority than constant active redundancy.

Among the various AWS disaster recovery options, the Warm Standby approach emerges as the ideal fit for core banking operations due to its adept combination of rapid recovery capabilities and cost-effectiveness.
